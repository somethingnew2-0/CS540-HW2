Decision Trees

The dataset you will learn to classify is a set of credit information collected in Germany. It includes personal
finance status for many individuals and the prediction as to whether or not their credit is considered good.
Information which, for instance, a bank might want to determine if they should provide a loan or not to an
individual. 
There are a total of 300 records, or instances, which have been divided into: a training set of 200 instances, a
tuning set of 50 instances, and a test set of 50 instances. Each record is composed of 7 attributes, each attribute
related to the financial status of an individual. Some of the attributes are categorical while others are numerical.
You will use some combination of these 7 attributes to build your decision tree. Please see the data description
file (german.desc) for more information, including attribute names and values.
